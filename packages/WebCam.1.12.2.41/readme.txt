Welcome to the SignalPop WebCam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WebCam is an open-source technology (based on the original DirectXCapture
open-source project available at directxcapture.wikidot.com) that allows easy
access to WebCams for Windows C# applications.  MyCaffe (curated by  
SignalPop) uses the WebCam for Video Data for Single-Shot MultiBox Detection 
(SSD) video input.

FINAL INSTALLATION STEPS:

To use the WebCam Sample, just declare the WebCam sample and call its
ShowDialg method as shown below:

WebCamSample.WebCamDialog dlg = new WebCamSample.WebCamDialog();
dlg.ShowDialog();


WebCam is also available on GitHub at http https://github.com/mycaffe.

If you are looking for tools to visualize and debug your deep learning
models, check out the SignalPop AI Designer, where you can visually edit 
models, manage training sessions and debug your training in real-time. 
The SignalPop AI Designer now supports SSD, deep auto-encoder networks, 
domain adversarial neural networks (DANN), Policy Gradient and DQN reinforcement
learning.

You can try the SignalPop AI Designer demo version for free at:
